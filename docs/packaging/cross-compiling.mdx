# Cross Compiling
<AppliesTo all />
Compiling releases for a OS different for the one you are using.

## Runtime vs. cross compiling

Using the `--runtime` argument [[Read more]](./runtime.mdx) is a great way to tell Velopack what CPU or OS _version_ your software supports, but it does not 
enable cross compiling by default and if you try to use `--runtime linux-x64` on a Windows machine, you will get a "Not Supported" error message.

This is because, by default, Velopack thinks that you are always trying to compile a release for the OS you are currently using.

## How to cross compile
Since command line arguments available for each OS are slightly different, you need to explictly opt-in to cross compiling by using using a CLI directive. 

The following directives are available:
- `vpk [win]`
- `vpk [linux]`
- `vpk [osx]`

For example, if you wish to compile a linux package while using a Windows machine, you would use the following commands:
- `vpk [linux] -h`
- `vpk [linux] pack -h`
- `vpk [linux] pack --runtime linux-x64 --mainExe yourExeName --packId YourAppId ...`

Before running a command for a different OS, you should review the help text of that command using `vpk [os] -h` to see the available options.

## Supported configurations

- It is possible to create Windows packages on any OS (Windows, Linux, or MacOS). 
- It is possible to create Linux packages on any OS (Windows, Linux, or MacOS).
- It is not possible to create MacOS packages on Windows or Linux. Due to the hard dependencies on tools like `codesign`, `xcrun`, `productbuild` and so forth, 
  you must use a MacOS machine to create MacOS packages.
