# Authentication
<AppliesTo all />

<FlowLink /> supports OAuth, forms authentication, and API keys for authentication. You can use any of these methods to authenticate with the Flow service. The recommended method is to use OAuth, as it provides the most secure and flexible authentication mechanism.

To perform an interactive login use the `vpk login` command. This will persist your authentication locally inside of `~/.vpk`. For running commands without interaction, such as a CI/CD pipeline, you can specify the `--api-key` option to the `vpk` commands that interact with Flow. 

# API
<FlowLink /> offers a REST API for interacting with the service. There is an OpenAPI specification available at https://api.velopack.io/swagger that describes the API endpoints and their parameters. This API allows you to build your own automation tools that integrate with Velopack Flow.

`vpk` supports making direct calls against this API using the `vpk flow api` command. This command allows you to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the Flow API. You can use this command to automate tasks such as creating projects, uploading releases, and managing channels. 

Some sample commands for managing projects:
- Getting a list of projects: `vpk flow api -m GET -e "v1/projects/list"`
- Create a new project: `vpk flow api -m POST -e "v1/projects/create" -b '{"name": "My Project Name", "teamIdentifier": "Default Team", "packageId": "company.package.id"}'`
- Deleting a project: `vpk flow api -m DELETE -e "v1/projects/$($project.id)"`

For all of the available options see the [vpk CLI documentation](../reference/cli).
