# Build Velopack SDK
<AppliesTo all />
The Velopack SDK is responsible for compiling releases and installers.

It is made up of:
- Rust binaries which are re-distributed with installed apps, 
- .NET NuGet package (`Velopack`), 
- .NET command line tool (`vpk`). 

In order to test the project, you need to build the Rust binaries before compiling dotnet.   

### Prerequisites
 - [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
 - [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
 - [Rust / Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-coverage`
 - `dotnet tool install -g nbgv`

### Debug / Test
On windows, you need to build the Rust binaries using the `windows` feature before running tests. On OSX, you should run `cargo build` instead. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/bins
cargo build --features windows
cd ../../
dotnet build
dotnet test --no-build
```

### Release / Build
This is slightly complicated, because you will need to compile Rust on x64 OSX and x64 Windows before creating the final packages.

On OSX:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/bins
cargo build --release
```

On Windows:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/bins
cargo build --release --features windows
copy {path_to_osx_update} target/release/updatemac
dotnet build -c Release /p:PackRustAssets=true
```

### Preparing Linux
If you are on Linux (tested on Ubuntu), there are additional package pre-requisites:
```shell
sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

Installing dotnet and setting up the paths are a pain, I recommend using the [dotnet-install.sh](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) script.

```shell
./dotnet-install.sh -c 6.0
./dotnet-install.sh -c 8.0
```

And then adding the following to the bottom of your `.bashrc` or `.profile`:

```shell
export DOTNET_ROOT="$HOME/.dotnet"
export DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
```

Next, install the missing dotnet tools:

```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-coverage
dotnet tool install -g nbgv
```

You need to verify that `nbgv` is working on the command line (eg. `nbgv -h`) before continuing. 
If it's not working, check that your tools installed to `~/.dotnet/tools`. If you did not use the `dotnet-install.sh` script,
dotnet could be at a different location (eg. `/usr/share/dotnet`) and the paths above will need to be updated.

Once dotnet is configured, you can Install Rust, typically done with the [rustup script available here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

To verify that Rust is installed and working correctly, you should compile the Rust binaries in `src/Rust`:

```shell
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```
