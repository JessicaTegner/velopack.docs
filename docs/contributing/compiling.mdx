# Build Velopack SDK
<AppliesTo all />
The Velopack SDK is responsible for compiling releases and installers.

It is made up of:
- Rust binaries which are re-distributed with installed apps, 
- .NET NuGet package (`Velopack`), 
- .NET command line tool (`vpk`). 

In order to test the project, you need to build the Rust binaries before compiling dotnet.   

### Prerequisites
 - [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
 - [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
 - [Rust / Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-coverage`
 - `dotnet tool install -g nbgv`

### Debug / Test
On windows, you need to build the Rust binaries using the `windows` feature before running tests. On OSX, you should run `cargo build` instead. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/Rust
cargo build --features windows
cd ../../
dotnet build
dotnet test --no-build
```

### Release / Build
This is slightly complicated, because you will need to compile Rust on x64 OSX and x64 Windows before creating the final packages.

On OSX:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/Rust
cargo build --release
```

On Windows:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.git
cd velopack/src/Rust
cargo build --release --features windows
copy {path_to_osx_update} target/release/updatemac
dotnet build -c Release /p:PackRustAssets=true
```

### Compiling on Linux
If you are on Linux (tested on Ubuntu), there are additional package pre-requisites:
```sh
sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config 
```
You need to verify that `nbgv` is working on the command line, you may be missing a `DOTNET_ROOT` variable in your bash profile, which might need to point at `/usr/share/dotnet` or `$HOME/.dotnet`. 

If you are missing localisation packages, you can search for them or add the following to your bash profile:

```bash
export DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1
```
