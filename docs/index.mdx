# Introduction
Velopack is an installation and auto-update framework for cross-platform desktop applications. It's opinionated, extremely easy to use with zero config needed. With just one command you can be up and running with an installable application, and it's lightning fast for your users, too.

Be sure to check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/velopack/velopack) and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/CjrCrNzd3F) for any questions/support!

## Overview
To enable your application to make full use of Velopack, you need to do 3 things:

<FancyStep step={1}>
### Integrate the SDK & check for updates
We have client libraries for some [languages below](#language-support), or if we don't support your language yet you can use [our CLI](./getting-started/fusion-cli.mdx). <br/>
[Read more ‚Üí](integrating/overview.mdx)
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={2}>
### Build a Velopack release
Our command-line tool `vpk` can help you build update packages and installers in just one command. <br/>

</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={3} noline>
### Upload your releases somewhere
You can host updates anywhere static files can be served, eg. cloud file storage, GitHub Releases, and more. <br/>
