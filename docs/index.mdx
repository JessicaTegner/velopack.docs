# Introduction
Velopack is an installation and auto-update framework for cross-platform desktop applications. It's opinionated, extremely easy to use with zero config needed. With just one command you can be up and running with an installable application, and it's lightning fast for your users, too.

Be sure to check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/velopack/velopack) and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/CjrCrNzd3F) for any questions/support!

## Overview
To enable your application to make full use of Velopack, you need to do 3 things:
1. Integrate the SDK into your app, and check for updates. [[Read more]](integrating/overview.mdx)
0. Run the `vpk` command line tool to generate your update packages and installers. [[Read more]](packaging/overview.mdx)
0. Upload your release somewhere your app can download updates from. [[Read more]](distributing/overview.mdx)
