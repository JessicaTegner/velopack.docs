            <strong>Publish App</strong>
        </summary>

        Before building a Velopack release, you must first build your application and publish it to a directory.

        For simplicity, we recommend publishing it as a [self-contained application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained).

        ```batch
        dotnet publish yourApp.csproj -c Release --self-contained -r win-x64 -o .\publish
        ```
        <Admonition type="tip">
            Starting with .NET 7, the `-o`/`--output` option [can no longer be used with a solution file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/7.0/solution-level-output-no-longer-valid?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003472).
        
            Starting with .NET 8 and later, the `dotnet publish` command defaults to the Release configuration, so you can omit the `-c Release` option.
            For more details see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/dotnet-publish-config.
        
            If you execute the dotnet publish command from within the same directory as the .csproj file, you can omit the project argument. You can find more details on the [dotnet publish documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003472#arguments).
