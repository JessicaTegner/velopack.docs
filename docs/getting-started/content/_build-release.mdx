You are now ready to build a Velopack release for your application. 

The `--packId` can be any unique application identifier that you wish to use. Because this must be unique across all applications, 
we recommend including your company name: `<CompanyName>.<AppName>`.

The `--mainExe` option is only required if your executable name is different than the `--packId` of your application.

See the [CLI reference](/reference/cli/) for more details on the available options.

```cmd
vpk pack --packId YourAppId --packVersion 1.0.0 --packDir .\publish --mainExe yourMainApp.exe
```

{props.includeWarningTip && (
<Admonition type="tip">
    <code>vpk</code> will produce the a warning saying that the <code>VelopackApp.Run()</code> was 
    not found in the entry point of your application. 
    This is expected, and the warning can be safely ignored for this type of application.
</Admonition>
