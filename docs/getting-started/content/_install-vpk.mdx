Velopack uses a command line tool called `vpk` to package and publish releases. 
It is distributed as a [.NET global tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools). Though Velopack can be used with app from [various languages](/#language-support), the .NET is required to install and run `vpk`.
You can install the .NET SDK from the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).

Once .NET is installed, you can install `vpk` by running:
```cmd
dotnet tool install -g vpk
```
