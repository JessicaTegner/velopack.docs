# Getting Started: Uno Platform
<AppliesTo all />

The Uno Platform provies .NET developers with an open-source platform for building single codebase native mobile, web, desktop and embedded apps quickly. Velopack offers a cross platform solution for deploying the desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux) versions of those applications. For publishing other platforms see [Uno Platform's documentation](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/uno-publishing-overview.html).

1. Start by creating a new Uno application following [Uno Platform's Getting Started guide](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started.html). 

0. Add the Velopack NuGet package to the Uno project by running 
   ```cmd
   dotnet add package Velopack
   ```

0. Inside of the App.xaml.cs add the following lines to the beginning of the constructor.
   ```csharp
   public App()
   {
       // It's important to Run() the VelopackApp as early as possible in app startup.
       VelopackApp.Build()
           .WithFirstRun((v) => { /* Your first run code here */ })
           .Run();
       this.InitializeComponent();
   }
   ```

0. Add automatic updating somewhere in your app:
   ```cs
   private static async Task UpdateMyApp()
   {
       var mgr = new UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates");

       // check for new version
       var newVersion = await mgr.CheckForUpdatesAsync();
       if (newVersion == null)
           return; // no update available

       // download new version
       await mgr.DownloadUpdatesAsync(newVersion);

       // install new version and restart app
       mgr.ApplyUpdatesAndRestart(newVersion);
   }
   ```

0. Compile the artifacts to be deployed. Though it is not strictly necessary to set an assembly version, it is best practice to version the application to match the installer version.  
   ```cmd
   dotnet publish -f net8.0-desktop -p:Version=1.0.0 -o .\publish
   ```
   This will create the artifacts to be installed inside of the `publish` directory. If you are targeting Windows or Mac Catalyst separately this process will need to be repeated for each of those platforms.
   For additional information on publishing your Uno application see the [Uno publishing guides](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/uno-publishing-overview.html)

0. Install the Velopack command line utility. This is installed as a [dotnet global tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools). Install it by running
   ```cmd
   dotnet tool install -g vpk
   ```

0. Build the installer. For this example, we will provide the same version number for the installer as we did above for the application version. 
   ```cmd
   vpk pack --packId <AppId> --packVersion 1.0.0 --packDir .\publish --mainExe <MyUnoApp>.exe
   ```
   The AppId can be any unique application identifier that you wish to use. Typically this will be the same as the name as your application. The --mainExe option is only required if your executable name is different than the --packId of your application.
   :::tip
   VPK will produce the following warning that can safely be ignored:
   `VelopackApp.Run() was found in method 'System.Void <YourAppName>.App::.ctor()', which does not look like your application's entry point. It is strongly recommended that you move this to the very beginning of your Main() method.`
   :::
   For more information on this warning see [Integration Overview](../integrating/overview.mdx#application-startup)
   By default, Velopack will create the installers and the needed installer files inside of a Release directory. This can be configured with the --outputDir option. 

âœ… You're Done! These files can then be uploaded it a [variety of locations for distribution](../distributing/overview.mdx).
