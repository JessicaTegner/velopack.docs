# Getting Started: C++
<AppliesTo all />
Get started with our cross-platform C++ header library.

1. Copy [Velopack.hpp](https://github.com/velopack/velopack.fusion/blob/master/for-cpp/Velopack.hpp) and [Velopack.cpp](https://github.com/velopack/velopack.fusion/blob/master/for-cpp/Velopack.cpp) into your project. 

0. Configure Unicode Support:
    #### Windows
    On Windows, to enable unicode support for this library you ***must*** 
    [configure the UTF-8 code page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page) via your application 
    manifest. Failure to do so will potentially result in your application ***failing to update*** if there are any unicode characters in your user's 
    file paths, username, etc.
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <assembly manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
      <application>
        <windowsSettings>
          <activeCodePage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2019/WindowsSettings">UTF-8</activeCodePage>
        </windowsSettings>
      </application>
    </assembly>
    ```
    #### Linux & MacOS
    - If you are using Qt and `QString` is available, there's nothing further you need to do. 
    - If you are not using Qt, you'll need to [install ICU4C](https://icu.unicode.org/). Like many other C libraries, 
      installing the development package with your package manager (`apt`, `brew` etc) *should* be sufficient to make it available to compilers.

0. Add the `Velopack::startup()` to your entry point (eg. `main()` or `wmain()`) as early as possible, ideally the first statement to run:
    ```cpp
    #include "Velopack.hpp"

    wmain(int argc**, wchar_t *argv[ ], wchar_t *envp[ ])
    {
        // Velopack may exit / restart your app at this statement
        Velopack::startup(argv, argc);

        // ... your other startup code here
    }
    ```

0. Add auto-updates somewhere to your app:
    ```cpp
    #include "Velopack.hpp"
    #include <memory>

    static void update_app()
    {
        Velopack::UpdateManagerSync manager{};
        manager.setUrlOrPath("https://the.place/you-host/updates");

        auto updInfo = manager.checkForUpdates();
        if (updInfo == nullptr) {
            return; // no updates available
        }

        manager.downloadUpdates(updInfo->targetFullRelease.get());
        manager.applyUpdatesAndRestart(updInfo->targetFullRelease.get());
    }
    ```

0. Install the `vpk` command line tool:
    ```sh
    dotnet tool update -g vpk
    ```
    :::tip
    ***You must have the .NET Core SDK 8 installed to use and update `vpk`***
    :::


0. Compile your app to a program using your usual compiler (eg. msvc, cmake, gcc, etc)

0. Copy `Vfusion.exe`, `VfusionMac` or `VfusionNix` to your build output folder. This is a manual step for now, but may be automated in the future. You can compile this yourself, download a [recent build artifact](https://github.com/velopack/velopack.fusion/actions), or grab the latest [npm release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/velopack?activeTab=code) which also bundles the binaries.
    :::warning
    Until this is automated, failing to copy the fusion binary to your update directory will result in your app being unable to update.
    :::

0. Package your Velopack release / installers:
    ```sh
    vpk pack -u MyAppUniqueId -v 1.0.0 -p /myBuildDir -e myexename.exe
    ```

âœ… You're Done! Your app now has auto-updates and an installer.
You can upload your release to your website, or use the `vpk upload` command to publish it to the destination of your choice.
