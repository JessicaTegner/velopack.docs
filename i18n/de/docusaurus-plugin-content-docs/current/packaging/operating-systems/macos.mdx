# MacOS Overview

MacOS specific notes about creating and using Velopack packages.

For Mac, applications are distributed as `.app` bundles. These are special folders that appear in Finder like a single file.

## Packaging

If you are creating a custom bundle, you can provide a folder ending in `.app` to the `--packDir` / `-p` argument, Velopack will copy and use this directly.
If you do not wish to create the `.app` bundle manually, Velopack can do this for you, so just supply any other folder (which does not end in `.app`) to the `--packDir` argument.

If you wish for Velopack to automatically create a bundle, the only additional argument you need to provide is `--icon`, and this must be a valid `.icns` file.

:::warning
[Code signing and notarization](../signing.mdx) is required by Apple before shipping your releases to users, or your app won't run.

## Updating

During updates, packages are downloaded to `/tmp`, and during apply step the `.app` bundle will be extracted and replaced. 

If the `.app` is installed to `/Applications` (and not `~/Applications` for example), elevation may be required. 
In this case, the updater will use AppleScrpt to request elevation and complete the update. 
The `.app` bundle created by Velopack does not need to be in `/Applications` to support updates, it is a portable / self contained bundle
and if it is moved by the user it is still capable of applying updates.

The app can technically be updated while it's running, although Velopack will make an effort to close/restart it to clear out any old versions curently running.

## Installing

Velopack will automatically generate and sign a `.pkg` installer for you, which allows you to show a readme, conclusion, license page, etc. 
See the command line help for a complete list of options.
It also allows the user to choose whether to install to `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, and will launch the app automatically after it's been installed. 

If you do not wish to ship a pkg, Velopack also creates a portable `.zip` which will be automatically extracted if clicked by the user in Finder.
If you wish to ship a DMG instead, you can unzip this portable package and create a DMG that way.
