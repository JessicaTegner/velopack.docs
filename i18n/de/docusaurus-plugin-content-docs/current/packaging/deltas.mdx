# Delta Updates

<AppliesTo all />
Delta updates provide speedy updates for even the biggest of applications.

By default, as long as there is a previous release in your `--outputDir` / `-o` directory, Velopack will automatically generate a delta when creating a new release.

:::tip
If you don't have the latest local release, eg. you're running in CI, you can use the `vpk download` command to automatically fetch it so delta's can be created.

Delta packages use [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) to create binary patches of individual files in your package. Due to limitations of Zstandard, no single file can be bigger than 2 GB.

## Optimising for size

The default parameters picked for patch generation are to provide a good balance of size and speed. 
If you would like to optimize for size, you can do this with the `--delta BestSize` argument.
YMMV, for some appliations this may give you big size savings, for others it may not. Either way it will be a lot slower, about on-par with the `bsdiff` algorithm.

## How delta's work

During updates, Velopack will look for possibly more than one delta to download. Imagine you have published the following releases:

- `1.0.0`
- `1.0.1`
- `1.0.2`
- `1.0.3`

If a user has not opened your app in a while, and has `1.0.0` installed, the next time they open the app, 
3 delta's will be downloaded: `1.0.1-delta`, `1.0.2-delta`, and `1.0.3-delta`.

The previously downloaded/installed package is stored in `%LocalAppData\{packId}\packages`, so Velopack will then apply those 3 delta's sequentially 
on top of the local package that exists in that directory. 

Once the delta's have been applied, and the `1.0.3` release has been reconstructed, it will be ready for applying. 

There is a heuristic in Velopack which will attempt to decide whether it is better to download N delta's or download the latest full release instead.
This is based on a number of factors (eg. size of the full release, sum size of the delta's, total number of delta's between the current & target version).

## GitHub Releases

There is special support for GitHub Releases in `UpdateManager` which will search through a number of previous GitHub Releases for available delta's. 
This means any one GitHub release must only have 1 full package and 1 delta update to facilitate proper updating. 

## Disabling delta's

If for some reason you don't want to deploy delta's, you can disable them with the `--delta none` argument.
